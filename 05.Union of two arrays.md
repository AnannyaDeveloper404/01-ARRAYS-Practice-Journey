# Union of two arrays

Given two arrays arr1[] and arr2[], the task is to find the number of elements in the union between these two arrays.

The Union of the two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct elements from both arrays. If there are repetitions, then only one element occurrence should be there in the union.

Note: Elements are not necessarily distinct.

```
Examples

Input: arr1[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], arr2[] = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 5
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are the elements which comes in the union setof both arrays. So count is 5.
```

## CODE

```java
// User function Template for Java

class Solution {
    public static int doUnion(int arr1[], int arr2[]) {
        HashSet<Integer> hs=new HashSet<>();
        for(int val:arr1){
            if(!hs.contains(val)){
                hs.add(val);
            }
        }
        int count=0;
        for(int val:arr2){
            if(!hs.contains(val)){
                hs.add(val);
            }
        }
        return hs.size();
    }
}
```

## APPROACH

- **Step 1**: Add all elements of `array1` to a `HashSet`.
- **Step 2**: Iterate through `array2` and add each element to the `HashSet` only if it is not already present.

- **Time Complexity**:O(n)
- **Space Complexity**:O(n)
