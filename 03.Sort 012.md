# Sort 0s, 1s and 2s

Given an array arr containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s. Sort the array in ascending order.

```
Examples:

Input: arr[]= [0, 2, 1, 2, 0]
Output: 0 0 1 2 2
Explanation: 0s 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
```

### CODE

```java
class Solution {
   // Function to swap two elements in the ArrayList
   public void swap(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int i, int j) {
       int temp = arr.get(i);
       arr.set(i, arr.get(j));
       arr.set(j, temp);
   }

   // Function to sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s (ArrayList version)
   public void sort012(ArrayList<Integer> arr) {
       int j = 0;
       int k = arr.size() - 1;

       for (int i = 0; i <= k;) {
           if (arr.get(i) == 0 ) {
               swap(arr, i, j);
               i++;
               j++;
           } else if (arr.get(i) == 2) {
               swap(arr, i, k);
               k--;
           } else {
               i++;
           }
       }
   }
}
```

### Approach

Initialize three pointer : Two pointer at the begining,other at the end,the pointer `i` will check each
element to see if it is 1,2,0 ....
If it's `0` ,it will be swapped with `j`th element.then `i++` `j++`,if it's `2` then it will be swapped with `k`th element.then only `k--` as we dont know what was the element placed at `i`th position during the swap with kth element,so we will not `i++` this time.
as for `1`,we will increase the i pointers.
